<h1>The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Book</h1>
<h3>by Lawrence Liang</h3>
<p>A number of critical interventions in debates on the impact of intellectual property 
on knowledge and culture are framed by a critique of the expansionist tendency of 
the global intellectual property regime. There are calls for an institutional overhaul 
of the intellectual property regime to make it more equitable and to enable greater 
access to knowledge and culture. What seems to be missing in these debates in the 
registers of development discourse or in the mandates of liberal reformist agendas 
are epistemological challenges to intellectual property. The success of intellectual 
property as a concept perhaps lies more in its ability to have established itself in a 
universally intelligible narrative concerning what constitutes selfhood and ownership 
than in specific instances of its enforcement within countries. Ideas of property 
are centrally tied to larger ideas of personhood and hence are far too important 
to be left to policy makers.</p> 
 
<p>The globalization of intellectual property is hence as much about the creation 
of a mind-set that sees all forms of creative activity as property as it is about universal 
norms. It also articulates a particular idea of authorship tied closely to the 
idea of an individual’s relation to the world of knowledge and culture. This paper 
argues that unless we understand the epistemological challenges posed by the idea 
of intellectual property, we are left with limited corrective measures to a system 
that threatens to destroy the diversity that marks our relation to the world of 
ideas and consequently our relation to others and to ourselves.</p> 
 
<p>I will be examining the link between ideas of personhood and self that underlies 
Western liberal property regimes. Philosophers such as John Locke played a 
key role in creating a link between the “self” and “ownership.” This paper examines 
alternative ideas of the self within Western and non-Western metaphysics and 
argues that a relational conception of the self helps us rethink our assumptions 
about property and personhood, especially in relation to the world of knowledge 
and culture. The political implications of such a shift are many and can be best 
seen in the normative aspirations of the access to knowledge movement, which 
attempts to destabilize the language of exclusive rights and property and to focus 
on the ideas of responsibility and obligation as part of the ecology of knowledge.</p> 
 
<p>My account of the puzzle of property and personhood in relation to intellectual 
property begins with what seems to be a standard copyright dispute. In 1999, three 
members of the 1980s band Spandau Ballet sued Gary Kemp, the fourth member 
of the band, for not sharing the royalties to the band’s songs, which they claimed 
they had jointly authored.<sup>1</sup> Kemp claimed that he was the sole author of the songs 
and that he was not obliged to pay them any share of the royalties. The aggrieved 
members of the band argued that while Kemp presented the “bare bones” of a tune 
to the other band members, the band went through a process of jamming, whereby 
“someone started to play and the rest joined in and improvised and improved the 
original idea”—in other words, that the creation of the songs was a collaborative 
process and that the songs should be considered a work of joint authorship.<sup>2</sup></p> 
 
<p>The court analyzed the manner in which music was created and, while acknowledging 
that there was a collaborative process that went into the composing of the 
music, they held that it was Kemp who should be considered the sole creator of the 
songs. They argued that Kemp “developed, and fixed in his musical consciousness, 
the melody, the chords, the rhythm or groove, and the general structure of [each] 
song from beginning to end” before playing it to the band and inviting the band as 
a whole to rehearse its performance as an ensemble with a view to recording it. The 
judge accepted that the other band members’ vocal and instrumental performances 
were skilful individual interpretations of the musical works that Kemp had composed. 
However, he held that an interpretation of a musical work was not the kind 
of contribution that the law of copyright could accept as sufficient to constitute 
the interpreter an author of that work: “the contributions need to be to the creation 
of musical works, not to the performance or interpretation of them.”<sup>3</sup></p> 
 
<p>The Spandau Ballet case illustrates an interesting and in many ways typical 
problem that copyright law faces in its adjudication of claims of authorship 
and creativity. My interest in the case emerges from the ways in which the case 
attempts to deal with the questions of collaboration, property, and personhood. In 
the Spandau Ballet case, there seem to be three distinct kinds of claim made about 
the relationships involved in these questions: Kemp’s claim (affirmed by the court) 
that the songs were written solely by him and hence are his own songs (a claim 
based on the songs’ relationship to the self), the claim that as a result, Kemp owns 
the songs exclusively (a claim based on his relationship to the work), and the claim 
that as an owner, Kemp is entitled to exclude others from a share in the royalties 
arising from the songs (a claim based on his relationship to others).</p> 
 
<p>At the heart of the problem, and of our understanding of the philosophical 
divide that exists in debates on intellectual property, lies the issue of property 
and personhood. The language of property narrates the individual as a proprietor 
of one’s own person, and it gives rise to a theory of personal identity in which the 
self and what it owns are often treated as being the same, or at least as existing 
within the same orbit of meaning, whereby the one can be used interchangeably 
with the other. This discourse flows directly from classical liberal political theory, 
in which every individual is considered to be the proprietor of his or her own 
person.</p> 
 
<p>locke and the equation of self and ownership</p> 
 
<p>The philosopher who is most often identified with this theory of property and 
the self is of course John Locke. Many of our ideas of selfhood emerged in the 
seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and in many ways, the question of personal 
identity was the prime question that motivated Locke’s inquiries. His theories set 
the stage for the philosophical and juridical establishment of what C. B. Macpherson 
calls the theory of “possessive individualism.”4 The question of personal identity 
troubled many philosophers before Locke, but it was with the publication 
of Locke’s Two Treatises of Government and An Essay Concerning Human Understanding 
that the most coherent argument linking theories of identity to property 
emerged. It is interesting to note that Locke initially did not have a chapter 
on consciousness and identity in the Essay, and it was at the suggestion of William 
Molyneux that he included a section on the principium individuationis to the 
second edition.</p> 
 
<p>Consider, for instance, the following statement in Locke’s journals: “Identity 
of persons lies not in having the same numerical body made up of the same particles, 
nor if the mind consists of corporeal spirits in their being the same. But in 
the memory and knowledge of one’s past self and actions continued on under the 
consciousness of being the same person whereby every man own’s himself.”5 For 
Locke, consciousness is a question of mental operations that appropriate the self 
to itself, where to appropriate means to identify with or to make a property of. 
The use of the word “own” is both as an adjective (as in “my own thought”) and 
as a verb (to confess). The relationship between the self and the own is therefore 
dependent on a circularity whereby ideas of identity and identification on 
the one side and appropriation on the other continuously exchange their function 
and become virtually equivalent. The relationship between the self and the 
own is dependent on a self-fulfilling prophesy in which “what I can consider as 
me, myself, is my self and ‘my’ self is some ‘thing’ that I own, or that I must own 
the man who mistook his wife for a book 281 
(confess) is mine, was done or thought by me, has become my own because I 
appropriated it to me by doing it or thinking it consciously.”6</p> 
 
<p>This circularity also informs much of Western metaphysics, in which consciousness 
sets the criteria of personal identity and of a political theory in which the 
possessive individual is generalized or universalized because any individual ought 
to be considered as proprietor of his or her own person or as a self-owning personality 
to the extent that he or she is such a proprietor. In a fascinating rereading 
of Locke,  tienne Balibar, citing Jacques Derrida, claims that the reason for this 
equivalence is the “metaphysics of (a)propriation,” in which linguistic expression 
is provided by the circularity of meanings between “my self” and “my own,” or the 
fact that you can explain self only by referring to what is your own and your own 
only by referring to yourself. This is at the heart of European psychological, moral, 
juridical, and political individualism and on the surface of it, it does seem that my 
self and my own are one and the same thing.</p> 
 
<p>The circular relationship between the self and the own appears at first glance 
to pose a problem of translatability. For instance, if you attempt to translate the 
terms “self” and “own” into French, while “self” can more or less accurately be 
translated as moi or soi, the closest French word for “own” is le propre or propre, 
with its very close relation to property. The pair “self”/”own” and moi/propre, 
however, cannot be considered as accurate equivalents. One could blame the inherently 
flawed project of translation, with the problem seen as being on a par with 
other conceptual/linguistic problems that have plagued philosophers involving the 
precise meaning of a word in different languages. However, Balibar sees it as a far 
more serious problem. He wonders if it is the easy semantic coincidence available 
in English that enables the easy linkage of the self and the own that allows for 
Locke’s theory of identity and property.</p> 
 
<p>To test Balibar’s hypothesis, I attempted to look for an equivalent in Hindi 
of the ideas of “my self” and “my own.” The closest translation that I could find 
emerges from the phrase “mere apne” which is the equivalent of “my own.” The 
word apna refers to the idea of owning, but not merely in terms of possession. 
The phrase “mere apne” could refer to something as being mine, but at the same 
time, this claim is not limited only to an assertion of delineation and exclusion, but 
refers instead to a certain idea of relationship of proximity between the self and 
an other. The word apnaapan, for instance, translates as “closeness,” so that “mere 
apne” is a reference to the idea of a relational proximity.</p> 
 
<p>This is interestingly mirrored by Balibar’s reading of “By the Fireside,” a poem 
by Robert Browning:7</p> 
 
<p>My own, confirm me! If I tread<br /> 
This path back, is it not in pride<br /> 
To think how little I dreamed it led<br /> 
To an age so blest that, by its side,<br > 
Youth seems the waste instead?</p> 
 
<p>Balibar initially reads the poem as being addressed to oneself, or as self-interpellation, 
and as an appeal to memory, but realizes his mistake when he encounters 
the next lines and then a subsequent stanza:</p> 
 
<p>My own, see where the years conduct!<br /> 
At first, ’twas something our two souls<br /> 
Should mix as mists do. . . .<br /> 
My perfect wife, my Leonor,<br /> 
Oh heart, my own, oh eyes, mine too,<br /> 
Whom else could I dare look backward for,<br /> 
With whom beside should I dare pursue<br /> 
The path grey heads abhor?</p> 
 
<p>So what might be only a linguistic dilemma—is this an address to a self or an 
address to an other?—leads us back to the foundational question of the nature of 
self and subjectivity that is invoked when we speak of something being “our own.” 
The idea that “my own” could possibly refer not merely to a sovereign claim of the 
individual self but also to relationality involving others conflicts with the world of 
property norms in which a to say “my own” is an act that makes a claim of absolute 
possession, that declares the ability to exclude others, and that asserts the 
legal ability to alienate what you own.8</p> 
 
<p>relational proximities and the reworking of the self</p> 
 
<p>Thinking of our relation to the world of knowledge and culture via the trope of 
proximity enables us to rethink our relations to our work, to our selves, and to 
each other, not as distinct sets of legal relations bound together by the idea of 
rights, but as a continuum that blurs the boundaries between rights, obligations, 
and relationalities. Consider, for instance, the following statements, each of which 
refers to certain claims that sound deceptively similar, but that in fact exist in very 
different ethical and legal registers.</p> 
 
<p>This is my pen.<br /> 
This is my friend.<br /> 
This is my poem.</p> 
 
<p>The first statement refers to the classical conception of the claims of possessive 
individualism, in which the self and the owner exist as interchangeable 
concepts. This is “my” pen, and hence I own it. The second statement takes us into 
the domain of relational proximities, where an assertion of someone being your 
friend does not lead to an assumption, either of ownership or of exclusion, but 
into the domain of the closeness/apnaapan that you share with your friend. Thus, 
the statement “This is my friend” could well be mapped in terms of its presence in 
Hindi as “mere apne,” with a sense of “owning” that leads to an understanding of 
how close you are to someone.</p> 
 
<p>The third statement is perhaps the most deceptive, because to assert “This is 
my poem” within the social imaginary of intellectual property is to make a claim 
that sounds very much like “This is my pen,” whereas in fact, it might be more 
accurate to think of its claim as the same as “This is my friend.” And it is in this 
liminal space where poems look like pens that friendships get lost and property 
takes over.</p> 
 
<p>What is it about the logic of property and the language of rights in the domain 
of intangibles that creates this act of misrecognition? The ontological character of 
information, knowledge, and cultural practices provide them with an unboundedness, 
and very much like the world of social relations, they are not exhausted by 
acts of circulation. When was the last time we heard of the problem of someone 
having too many friends? The imposition of strictly defined norms of property 
rights, with its imagination of legitimate rights holders and trespassers, enforces a 
transition that converts the possibilities of friendship into acts of hostile takings.9</p> 
 
<p>The role of intellectual property and the language of rights creates a normativized 
and legalized domain in which our experience of social relations, with their 
attendant complexities, is unavailable to us except as juridically defined sets of 
relations. It would be useful at this stage for us to turn to our title character, who is 
derived from one of Oliver Sacks’s case studies, that of “Dr. P,” the man who mistook 
his wife for a hat. Sacks informs us that Dr. P suffers from a peculiar neurological 
disorder that affects his ability to retain visual recognition while retaining this 
ability to discern abstract figures, leading to a series of misrecognitions in which he 
is unable to distinguish his foot from his shoe and his wife from a hat. Sacks writes: 
</p> 
 
<p><small>By and large, he recognized nobody: neither his family, nor his colleagues, nor his 
pupil, nor himself. He recognised a portrait of Einstein because he picked up the 
characteristic hair and moustache; and the same thing happened with one or two 
other people. ‘Ach, Paul!’ he said, when shown a portrait of his brother. ‘That square 
jaw, those big teeth, I would know Paul anywhere!’ But was it Paul he recognised, or 
one or two of his features, on the basis of which he could make a reasonable guess 
as to the subject’s identity? In the absence of obvious ‘markers’, he was utterly 
lost. But it was not merely the cognition, the gnosis, at fault; there was something 
radically wrong with the whole way he proceeded. For he approached these faces— 
the man who mistook his wife for a book even of those near and dear—as if they were abstract puzzles or tests: He did not 
relate to them, he did not behold. No face was familiar to him, seen as a ‘thou’, 
being just identified as a set of features, an ‘it’. Thus there was formal, but no trace 
of personal, gnosis.10</small></p> 
 
<p>Dr. P provides us with a fascinating case study of how a neurological condition 
may completely alter our abilities to see and to relate to the phenomenological 
world. We can perhaps think of intellectual property rights as a similar affliction, 
founded on very particularized ideas of property and personhood, but narrated 
as universal truths, that prevents us from seeing our acts of reading, writing, creating, 
sharing, and borrowing in terms of the relational world that they occupy. 
Instead, we see them abstracted of their social relations.</p> 
 
<p>The equivalent of Dr. P in the world of ideas is Daniel Defoe, the great chronicler 
of piracy’s golden era, who writes that “A Book is the Author’s Property, ’tis 
the Child of his Inventions, the Brat of his Brain; if he sells his Property, it then 
becomes the Right of the Purchaser; if not, ’tis as much his own, as his Wife and 
Children are his own.” Defoe was of course writing at a time when wife and children 
could indeed be owned as property. But we now know better and understand that 
you cannot own your wife or your child, but you can feel that they are your own.</p> 
 
<p>So here we have before us the case study of Daniel Defoe, the man who mistook 
his wife for a book. His condition (unlike Dr. P’s) is not an isolated malady, 
and an increasingly large number of people are showing symptoms similar to 
Defoe’s, encouraged and enabled by the large institutional sponsors of the malady 
such as the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), a malady whose 
contagion is ensured by instruments such as the TRIPS Agreement.</p> 
 
<p>different traditions of the self</p>

<p>J. G. A. Pocock says that if property is both an extension of personality and a prerequisite 
of it, then we should be aware of the possibility that different modes 
of property may be seen as generally encouraging different modes of personality. 
11 One way in which we can rethink the idea of our relationship to what we 
create is not through terms of ownership, but through how close we are to it— 
through proximity. Proximity to people and things creates a relationship of care 
and responsibility, and when thought of in terms of things that we create, it allows 
us to create a different ethical register through which we can examine the relationship 
between property and personhood. For Locke and many other thinkers 
within the Western metaphysical tradition, the idea of a distinct self serves as the 
basis for a range of concerns, from self-identity, to moral agency, to property. This 
account of the self within the tradition of possessive individualism has been challenged 
both within the Western tradition and by non-Western accounts of the self. </p>

<p>Proximity may indeed be the basis on which alternative accounts of the self 
may be forcefully articulated, because it is accompanied by a whole host of ethical 
principles such as generosity and obligation that may help us order a different 
mode of dealing with what we “own.” Proximity or closeness is marked by a 
relationship of care, and if we are to revisit the three modes of relationality that 
I invoked in the Spandau Ballet case, we see that proximity reworks the way we 
see the three relations: the relation to the self (to be an author is not just to own 
a work, but to own up to the work), the relation to the work (taking care of what 
you own, or the duty of care that emerges from proximity), and the relation to 
others (a relation predicated on an ethical bond). </p>

<p>The opposite of an ethic of care and proximity is the violence and brutality 
that motivated Daniel Defoe to mistake his wife for a book. One consequence of 
the idea of a relational self is that it does not make sense to speak of an essential 
core that is the basis of a sense of unified self and self-identity. Let us consider 
two challenges to the idea of the unified self that informs Western metaphysics. 
The first challenge emerges from the contrast between the idea of the self in Western 
philosophy and its absence in the non-Western tradition, while the second 
challenge emerges from the Western philosophical tradition itself. </p>

<p>S. N. Balagangadhara, a philosopher whose work focuses on Indian traditions, 
argues that the basic idea of the self in Western cultures consists of a sense of “an 
inner core which is separable and different from everything else. In such a culture, 
when one speaks of ‘finding oneself’ one means that one should look inside oneself, 
get in touch with an inner self that is there inside oneself, and peel everything away 
that surrounds this core. To such a self, even its own actions can appear strange.”12 </p>

<p>Furthermore, Western culture allows each of us a self—a self waiting to be discovered 
within each one of us, something that can grow and actualize itself, that 
either realizes its true potential or fails to do so. Such a versatile self has various 
properties. One of them is its reflexivity: The self is aware of itself as a self, or it 
has self-consciousness. Consequently, human beings who are endowed with such 
selves are all self-conscious beings. As we know, most philosophers are agreed that 
self-consciousness typifies the uniqueness of human beings, and that this selfconsciousness 
distinguishes humans from the rest of nature. </p>

<p>Balagangadhara contrasts the idea of the self in non-Western cultures with 
that of the West by using an interesting example. He says that if you were to look 
at the different ways in which a culture talks about persons, you would often find 
that in Western cultures, in answer to a question such as “What kind of a person 
is he?” you would find straightforward answers such as “He is a friendly person.” 
However, the same question can elicit a different response in a non-Western culture, 
such as “He comes home every week to enquire after my health.” According 
to Balagangadhara, while this initially seems like a wrong answer or an indirect 
answer, answers of this kind are very typical in a country such as India. He says 
that by reading these answers as in fact direct answers, we can see the answer 
asserting an identity relation between actions and persons. That is, Indian culture 
does not draw a distinction between an agent who performs an action and the 
action that the agent performs. An agent is constituted by the actions that a he or 
she performs, or an agent is the actions performed and nothing more. </p>

<p>Thus for Balagangadhara, the self of a person is nothing other than the actions 
that the person performs. But these actions do not exist in isolation and are dependent 
in turn on how another person construes them: Person Y constructs person 
X’s self, just as person X constructs person Y’s self. Person Y is crucial for the construction 
of X’s self, because in the absence of Y, the actions that X performs are 
meaningless. That is, Y is required so that X’s actions may be seen as some specific 
type of action. If we were to restrict ourselves to X in order to talk about his or her 
self so as to contrast this notion with that of the West, we could say that the Western 
self consists of a bundle of meaningless actions. Because of this, the self of X 
depends upon continuously being recognized as such by Y. According to Balagangadhara, 
there is nothing unusual about this, and it gestures toward the fact that 
we are all relational selves, and you are only a son, a daughter, a father, a friend, 
and so on to the extent you are so recognized. And you can be thus recognized 
only when you perform those actions that are appropriate to the station of a son, a 
daughter, a father, a friend, and so on.13 </p>

<p>Let us now turn to another attempt at characterizing this idea of relationality 
or proximity, this time within more contemporary Western philosophy. Emmanuel 
Levinas is one of the key thinkers working with the idea of proximity or “being 
with” within the Western philosophical tradition, and his work has inspired a 
range of ethical philosophers as well as legal scholars to think through questions 
of the obligations that we may have to others. For Levinas, proximity implies a 
“closeness to others who can be approached but never reached. We are never 
exactly the same as another person, and in the trauma of that distance lies summoned 
our soul” and likewise our sense of responsibility.14 It is clear that unlike 
the non-Western idea of relationality that arises from a close sense of relationships, 
Levinas has a more expanded idea of relating. For him, “The relationship 
of proximity cannot be reduced to any modality of distance or geometrical contiguity, 
nor to the simple ‘representation’ of a neighbor; it is already an assignation, 
an extremely urgent assignation—an obligation, anachronously prior to 
any commitment.”15 For Levinas, the ability to be in a proximate relationship 
is what “intimates” an other, and this intimation forms the essence of who 
we are and why we have a responsibility to others. Levinas also sees proximity 
as a complete experience that in many ways exceeds our theories and ideas 
of the world. </p>

<p>The similarities between the idea of the relational self in non-Western thought 
and proximity in Levinas’s work is striking. Levinas is impressively nonchalant 
about other pressing concerns in Western metaphysics, including intentionality or 
the existence of an essential self that defines our being. He is instead more concerned 
with the domain of experience and how we act responsibly. The ability to 
act responsibly is in turn dependent on the ability to respond adequately, and the 
instantiation of a response dilutes any unified sense of self, since neither the self 
nor intentionality makes any sense outside of its relation to another. I’m already 
obligated and called before any decision on my part. Therefore, there is no point in 
asking whether or not my act(ion) of responsibility is free or voluntary. If responsibility 
is prior to freedom, neither chosen nor not chosen, it is out of the question 
to ask under what circumstances I am responsible. </p>

<p>revisiting locke </p>

<p>While it is tempting to contrast the idea of the relational self with the Lockean idea 
of the autonomous individual, the task turns out to be difficult. If we consider, for 
instance, Locke’s theory of relations, there are certain productive contradictions 
that emerge. Objects, according to Locke, are related to each other by the mind. He 
argues that there may be certain properties, for instance that of being white, that 
may not be a relational fact. But when we think of a relational idea, Locke suggests, 
that is, when we think of someone as a husband or as whiter than someone 
else, the mind is actually going beyond the particular to some other person or persons 
distinct from the self, and a relation is the result of this activity of the mind, 
which has simultaneously considered and compared two distinct things. 
For Locke, some relational terms such as “father and son,” “lesser and bigger,” 
and “cause and effect” are self-evident and can exist only together and explain 
each other. These correlative pairs “reciprocally intimate” each other, but it is not 
exactly clear whether there is a common reciprocal relational tie connecting these 
correlative pairs, a common relation that each member of the pair has toward the 
other that makes this correlation possible. This limitation seems to emerge from 
the fact that Locke sees the ability of naming and identifying relations as emerging 
solely from the mind. In other words, the ontological status of relations seems 
unequivocally mind-dependent for Locke. The question that then logically arises 
is, how does the mind create a set of relationships to itself? </p>

<p>It is perhaps useful at this stage to return to the site of our original problem: 
the equation of self and owner that emerges in Locke’s theory of property and 
personhood. We began by locating the conceptual problem within a specific linguistic 
dilemma: the manner in which English produces a reciprocal duality of the 
self, a self who is owning and a self who is owned. Balibar says that while it could 
be argued that this linguistic dilemma could be dismissed as a performative contradiction, 
it would be more useful to look at the productive nature of this contradiction 
and the manner in which it resolves the contradiction in Locke by introducing 
another element—that of uneasiness. </p>

<p>Balibar argues that for Locke, the process of identification or self-interpellation 
(I address myself) or the performative contradiction is already taken into account. 
For instance, in his segment on consciousness, Locke argues that there is no consciousness 
that is not associated with desire and at the same time troubled and 
pushed by it toward ever new contents or ideas, so that the notion of consciousness 
as a fixed or stable identity is a contradiction in terms. Consciousness is by its 
nature restless. It must escape itself toward new contents, and its identity is associated 
with a perpetual flow, escape, or train of ideas. The category that names this 
intrinsic association of consciousness is “uneasiness.” Balibar argues that in light 
of this, we may return to Locke’s identification of the self and owning and what it 
means to understand them as being exactly the same thing. He says that what is 
owned by me inasmuch as I own it (speaking, thoughts, actions) is the uneasiness 
of this relation and the fact that the identity or sameness of the self and its own 
does indeed exist, but only as an uneasy one.16 </p>

<p>He argues, by returning to his reading of Browning’s poem, that the critical 
element causing the uneasy appropriation of identity is the element of sexual difference. 
It is the other with whom I make one and the same precisely because 
we can never become wholly identified, indistinguishable, with whom I experience 
the uneasy relation of identity and difference, not only because it is conflictual. 
but because the identification of what is shared or what is the same and of 
what is separated or different can never be established in a clear-cut and stable 
manner: We “should mix as mists do.” The name of this uneasy experience conventionally 
is “love.” But we know that love is anything but a simple thing, perhaps 
because in love, there is precisely so much consciousness associated with 
so much desire.</p>

<p>The implications of this line of thought are immense for a rethinking of the 
idea of knowledge creation in terms of proximity. If my own work can exist only in 
a certain relationship with others, then can I ever claim what is my own in a manner 
that seeks to exclude any claims that others may have? </p>

<p>returning to the intellectual property debate </p>

<p>Let us now return to the domain that motivated this brief enquiry. The global 
acceleration of intellectual property norms in recent times is critically linked to 
a new articulation of our relationship to our selves, our work, and to others. The 
response that is required cannot be limited within the terms of political realism, 
whether of the left or the right. And the real potential of new modes of knowledge 
production and sharing (free software, open access) stem not from their status as 
solutions to the problem of the knowledge or information deficit alone, but from 
their rearticulation of alternative relationalities that do not generate untroubled 
and easy cohesive accounts of the self and its own. They instead offer us an opportunity 
to think about the ways in which acts of sharing create new forms of intimacies 
and of relating to each other. The global access to knowledge movement 
currently is as much premised on the language of rights and equity as it is dependent 
on acts of generosity and giving. In an era when the language of theft, mistrust, 
and panic marks our relation with the world, it is all the more important to 
recall the ethical basis of our relationships with each other and with the world. </p>

<p>Our global contemporary era is marked by all kinds of turbulences that momentarily 
dislodge our stable notions of the nation, identity, property, stability, friend 
and enemy, self and other. The experience of turbulence in an airplane induces the 
stranger next to you momentarily to become your most intimate human contact, 
while the uncertainty of the moment causes you to reach out to an unfamiliar, 
but reassuring hand. Only later does the uneasy recognition occur of a compact 
of unfamiliarity having been breached. Our abilities to communicate and to share 
ideas in ways that were hitherto unthought of provides us with an opportunity 
to rework our accounts of ourselves and the possible horizons of the relations we 
inhabit. Michel Foucault asks: </p>


<blockquote>what would be the value of the passion for knowledge if it resulted only in a certain 
amount of knowledgeableness and not, in one way or another and to the extent possible, 
in the knower’s straying afield of himself? There are times in life when the question 
of knowing if one can think differently than one thinks, and perceive differently 
than one sees, is absolutely necessary if one is to go on looking and reflecting at all.17 </blockquote>


<p>Seen in this light, what is narrated as transgressions in the world of ideas reappear 
as explorations and reinventions of the self, a curiosity about the other and 
perhaps a way of looking for your wife in what appears to be a hat or a book. 
“Hospitality,” “gratitude,” “friendship,” “caring,” “owning”—these almost sound 
like archaic words from a distant time in a period when juridical relations replace 
social relations and contracts of adhesion are more powerful than word of mouth. 
If gratitude is the moral memory of mankind, as Georg Simmel claimed,18 then it is 
perhaps time to refresh our memory dulled by the ubiquity of property and contracts. 
And frankly, it does not matter where these mnemonic tools emerge from, 
either temporally or spatially. If our sense of self has been narrowed by its linguistic 
affinity with the need to own, let’s start exploring other semantic worlds 
where we can multiply and expand the idea of the self. Here are some with which 
to begin. </p>

<p>The etymology of “data” comes from the Latin datum, which means a thing 
that is given, the neuter of which is “to give.” Similarly, the word daata in Hindi/ 
Sanskrit is taken to mean “the giver,” which suggests that we must always be generous 
with information and make gifts of our code, images, and ideas. To be stingy 
with data is to violate an instance of the secret and sacred compacts of homophonic 
words from different cultural/spatial orbits (daata in Hindi and “data” in 
English) as they meet in the liminal zone between languages, in the thicket of the 
sound of quotidian slips of the tongue. </p>

<p>Another entry point is provided by the common root words that bind the words 
“owe” and “own,” so if intellectual property is about thinking of ways of owning 
the future, perhaps we need to start thinking not only about how we own, but also 
how we owe the future. The point is not to take these systems of administering the 
world of knowledge and ideas as a given, but to think about the ways in which they 
enable us to work out our relation with ourselves. As Patricia Williams reminds us, 
“The task . . . is not to discard rights, but to see through or past them so that they 
reflect a larger definition of privacy and property: so that privacy is turned from 
exclusion based on self-regard into regard for another’s fragile, mysterious autonomy; 
and so that property retains its ancient connotation of being a reflection of 
that part of the universal self. The task is to expand private property rights into a 
conception of civil rights, into the right to expect civility from others.”19 </p>

<p>I end this piece with a small parable that many of us will have read while we 
were children. The story is from Antoine de Saint Exupery’s tale The Little Prince. 
The Little Prince visits a number of planets and encounters a range of different 
characters. On the fourth planet, he meets a businessman who owns millions of 
stars, and the reason why he owns them is because he was the first one to think 
of owning the stars. The Little Prince is perplexed, because he can’t seem to find 
a reason for owning the stars beyond the fact that they can be put in a bank to 
enable the businessman to buy more stars. The Little Prince tells the businessman 
that “I own a flower myself, which I water every day. I own three volcanoes, 
which I rake out every week. I even rake out the extinct one. You never know. So 
it’s of some use to my volcanoes, and it’s useful to my flower, that I own them. But 
you’re not useful to the stars.”20</p>

8 And yet at the same time it seems that there indeed does exist a large set of claims within 
diverse cultural traditions (including, as Browning shows, in English) in which a claim about 
something or someone may lie more in the domain of your relation with the person or object 
than as a claim of possession. In Nehiya (Cree), to refer to something as “mine” does not necessarily 
imply ownership, but refers instead to a relational proximity to objects (animate and 
inanimate) and to beings, along with the accompanying responsibilities and obligations that 
emerge from such a relational proximity.<br /> 
9 For an interesting contrast, see Stanley Cavell, A Pitch of Philosophy: Autobiographical Exercises 
(Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1994), where he argues that “those who are 
too sure ideas cannot be stolen like to say that ideas are not private property. But my feet are 
not my property, yet they are mine, and you are not to step on them. The punch line I have 
set up is not my property, but you are not to preempt it. My turn is not my property, but you 
are not to take it. Justice is not solely a measure of property rights” (p. 37).<br />
